# Super Hero Search App

This is a web application that allows users to search for information about their favorite super heroes. Users can search for any hero name and the app will redirect them to a page that displays information about the hero they searched for. Additionally, the app can suggest a hero for the user if they want to by clicking the 'random hero' button.

## Features

- Search for any super hero by name.
- Get information about the searched hero.
- Suggest a random hero.
- Innovative CSS features.

## Architecture

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has two different pages: the home page and the hero page. The home page contains the search input and the 'random hero' button. The hero page displays the information about the searched or suggested hero.

The app uses an API to fetch information about the heroes. The buttons functionalities from the home page are exported to the hero page using JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the app, simply open the home page in a web browser and search for the hero you want to know more about. You can also click the 'random hero' button to get a suggestion. Once you get to the hero page, you can scroll through the hero's information and learn more about them.
