This is a simple BMI calculator that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height inputs. The calculator also provides information about whether the user's weight is within a healthy range.

## Purpose

This project was created to improve my skills in working with the Document Object Model (DOM) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project specifically focuses on creating a BMI calculator that takes in weight and height inputs and calculates the user's Body Mass Index. By building this project, I aim to gain more experience in working with the DOM, manipulating HTML elements, and creating interactive web applications.

## Getting Started

To use this BMI calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The BMI calculator interface will load, and you can enter your weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters) to calculate your BMI.

## How to Use

1. Enter your weight (in kilograms) in the weight input field.
2. Enter your height (in centimeters) in the height input field.
3. Your calculated BMI will be displayed in the "Result" field, along with information about whether your weight is within a healthy range.

## Healthy Weight Range

The BMI calculator also provides information about whether a user's weight is within a healthy range. The healthy weight range is based on the user's BMI, as follows:

- If the user's BMI is less than 18.5, the calculator will display a message indicating that the user is underweight.
- If the user's BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9 (inclusive), the calculator will display a message indicating that the user's weight is within a healthy range.
- If the user's BMI is between 25 and 29.9 (inclusive), the calculator will display a message indicating that the user is overweight.
- If the user's BMI is 30 or greater, the calculator will display a message indicating that the user is obese.

## Formula Used

The formula used to calculate the BMI is as follows:

BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2
