# Reaction Bar

This is a simple web project that demonstrates the use of the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript to create an interactive reaction bar. The project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that work together to display a set of six images representing different reactions (love, wow, neutral, angry, shy, and sad) and keep track of the number of times each reaction has been clicked.

## Project Description
The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the web page, including the images that represent the reactions and a counter that displays the number of times each reaction has been clicked.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles that define the appearance of the web page, including the layout of the reaction bar and the styles of the images and counter.
- `reaction.js`: Contains the JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the web page, including event listeners that track clicks on the images and update the counter.
- `img/`: A directory containing all images used in the design.

## How to Use

To use the reaction bar, simply click on one of the six images representing different reactions. Each click will increment the counter next to the image, and the total count of all reactions will be displayed in the "Total Reactions" counter at the top of the page.

You can also reset the count of all reactions to zero by clicking on the "Reset Count" button at the bottom of the page.

## Installation

To install the reaction bar project, simply clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open the index.html file in your web browser to view the project.
